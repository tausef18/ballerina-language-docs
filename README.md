# The Ballerina Programming Language

*by James Clark with contribution from Ballerina Community*

This guide to Ballerina Programming Language, hereafter to be referred as “Ballerina”, assumes you are using 2021 version of Ballerina Programming Language, codenamed Swan Lake. The guide specifically refers to the version of Ballerina released on 2021-03-08 and is intended for experienced programmers who are well-versed with at least one language in the C language family.
C family languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and TypeScript have a syntax structure similar to C Programing Language. However, JavaScript, Typescript and Python, unlike other languages in the family, are dynamically-typed programming languages. The guide expects at least some familiarity with one of the statistically-typed programming language.
Ballerina, like C and Java, is a statically-typed programming languages and expects to learn about the variable types at compile time. Ballerina, as a statically typed programming language, expects programmers to specify type during each instance of variable declaration or will return error at compile time.
One of the key advantages of statically-typed programming language is this that a lot of bugs are detected at the compile time itself.
Ballerina, like most modern programming languages, support a rich set of system and user-created libraries alongside the core components of the programming language. The scope of this guide is limited to the core components only. 
In addition to Ballerina Common Specifications that are common to most programming languages, there is Ballerina Language Specification. Ballerina Language Specification is more precise and detailed but harder to understand and may not be under the scope of an inexperienced program.
Ballerina 2021 is backward compatible and, thus, any code written before the update will run just fine.
